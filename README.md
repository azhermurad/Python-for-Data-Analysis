## Introduction

NumPy is a fundamental package for numerical computations, and Pandas offers high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools. Together, they form a powerful toolkit for data scientists and analysts.

## Prerequisites

Before using this guide, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.6 or later
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Familiarity with fundamental data analysis concepts

## Installation

You can install NumPy and Pandas using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas
```




# NumPy Overview

NumPy (Numerical Python) provides support for arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

## Array Creation

- **From a list or tuple:**

  ```python
  import numpy as np

  array_from_list = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])




# Pandas Overview

Pandas is a data manipulation and analysis library built on top of NumPy. It provides two primary data structures: Series and DataFrame.

## Data Structures

### Series

- **Creating a Series:**

  ```python
  import pandas as pd

  series = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4])
